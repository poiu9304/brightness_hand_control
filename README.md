# brightness_hand_control

Hello! My name is Kirren. For my NVIDIA project usign the jetson nano, I have created a brightness ontrol system with your hand. Curretnyl my monitor can be very hard to adjust the screen brighntness without messin up other settings. So to counter this I have decided to build this.

#Libraries
This program works by installing a couple python module:
'[screen-brightness-control](https://pypi.org/project/screen-brightness-control/)'
'[Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe)'
'[Control Vision](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)'
'[Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)'

You may dowload them using these command in the termial:
    pip install mediapipe
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install screen-brightness-control
    pip install numpy
