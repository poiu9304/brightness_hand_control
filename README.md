# Brightness Hand Control

Hello! My name is Kirren. For my NVIDIA project usign the jetson nano, I have created a brightness control system with your hand. Currently my monitor can be very hard to adjust the screen brighntness without creating other problems and changing other settings. So to counter this I have decided to build this.

## Running the program
1. This program works by installing a couple python module:

* '[screen-brightness-control](https://pypi.org/project/screen-brightness-control/)'
* '[Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe)'
* '[Control Vision](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)'
* '[Numpy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numpy-in-python-set-1-introduction/)'

You can dowload them using these command in the termial:
```
$ pip install mediapipe
$ pip install opencv-python
$ pip install screen-brightness-control
$ pip install numpy
```

2. Copy the code from main.py and run it.
